        1. Is now a good time to become a web developer? (2021 update)
        Before you jump into a new career, it’s important to consider the path ahead. Can your new industry offer you 
        ample opportunity and stability? How likely are you to get hired after your chosen program or bootcamp?
        
        In the wake of 2020, these questions are more important than ever. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major 
        impact on the economy and on the job market, with hiring slowing down in many sectors. With that in mind, let’s 
        take a look at the state of the web development industry in 2021.
        
        Are web developers in demand right now?
        You’ll have noticed that, no matter what’s going on in the world around us, technology is omnipresent in our 
        lives. Whether it’s scrolling through our favorite social media apps, checking the news, paying for something 
        online, or connecting with colleagues using collaboration software and tools—most of what we do relies on some 
        form of technology. Behind this technology is a team of web developers who have not only built it, but constantly 
        maintain it to ensure it works flawlessly.
        
        Those who can build and maintain websites, apps, and software have a crucial role to play in today’s 
        technology-driven world—and this is reflected in the web development job market. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
        employment of web developers is projected to grow 8% from 2019 to 2029—much faster than the average for all occupations.
        
        But does this still stand after the unpredictable twists and turns of 2020? In a word, yes; web developers seem 
        to have weathered the storm relatively well. Full-stack developer came in second on indeed’s list of the best jobs 
        for 2020, and we can see this continuing through 2021 and beyond. Just search the web for the most in-demand tech skills 
        in 2021 and you’ll find things like web development, cloud computing, DevOps, and problem-solving.
        
        Full-stack development in particular will continue to be highly attractive to employers. Writing for TechCrunch, 
        Sergio Granada notes how full-stack developers have been integral to business during the Covid-19 crisis: “In response 
        to the coronavirus pandemic, the ability to do full-stack development can make engineers extremely marketable as companies 
        across all industries migrate their business to a virtual world. Those who can quickly develop and deliver software projects 
        thanks to full-stack methods have the best shot to be at the top of a company’s or client’s wish list.”
        
        If you’re keen to quantify the demand for web developers, search for “web developer” or “full-stack developer” roles 
        in your area on sites like indeed, glassdoor, and LinkedIn. We did a quick search for web development roles in the United 
        States and, at the time of writing, found over 26,000 vacancies (August update: There are now over 42,000 job ads!).
        
        As you can see, web developers continue to be in high demand—in spite of, and perhaps even more so because of, the ongoing 
        coronavirus pandemic. Speaking of which, how has Covid-19 affected the web development industry? Let’s take a look.
        
        How has Covid-19 affected the industry?
        While many industries have struggled (and continue to do so) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the tech industry has 
        fared relatively well. Many organizations are relying on digital tools to enable them to operate remotely, placing even more 
        importance on technology and the people who build it. As such, many are anticipating an industry boom: according to Market 
        Data Forecast, the tech industry will grow from $131 billion USD in 2020 to $295 billion in 2025.
        
        Of course, new and aspiring web developers can expect some changes as a result of Covid-19. First and foremost, it’s important 
        to consider the rise of remote work. When it comes to looking for your first job within the field, you should be prepared to work 
        remotely at least some of the time, if not on a full-time basis. Fortunately, web development is a career that lends itself 
        to remote work. You can learn more about what it’s like to work as a remote developer in this guide.
        
        We’re also anticipating that web developer jobs will increase in certain sectors as a direct result of the products and 
        services that are most in-demand right now. For example, sectors like healthcare, media and entertainment, online banking, 
        remote education, and e-commerce will continue to grow to reflect consumer needs and behaviors in a more socially-distant world.
        
        In all, the impact of Covid-19 on the tech industry, and on web developers, has been minimal compared to other sectors. 
        Although the situation is still unfolding, new and aspiring web developers can feel confident that they’re embarking on a future-proof career.
        
        If you’re curious as to what it’s like to be a newly-qualified tech graduate in the midst of a pandemic, take a 
        look at our guide to job searching during Covid-19. In it, Mike McCulloch, Head of Career Services at CareerFoundry, 
        shares his observations of the tech job market, together with some great advice on how to market yourself as a newcomer to the field.
        
        So…should you become a web developer in 2021?
        So what’s the verdict? Is now a good time to become a web developer?
        
        Looking at the job market and projected employment growth, we think the answer is pretty clear. Now is an 
        excellent time to become a web developer! Now more than ever, technology is pivotal to how we work, connect 
        with loved ones, access healthcare, shop…and the list goes on. If you’re thinking about joining this exciting 
        industry and building the technology of the future, we say go for it.
        
        But first, let’s get back to basics. What exactly is web development, and what does a web developer actually 
        do? Keep reading to find out.
        
        2. What is web development?
        Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network 
        known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the 
        coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.
        
        From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content
         management systems (CMS); all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web developers.
        
        Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side coding (backend) 
        and database technology.
        
        Let’s take a look at each of these layers in more detail.
        
        Client-side
        Client-side scripting, or frontend development, refers to everything that the end user experiences directly. 
        Client-side code executes in a web browser and directly relates to what people see when they visit a website. 
        Things like layout, fonts, colours, menus and contact forms are all driven by the frontend.
        
        Server-side
        Server-side scripting, or backend development, is all about what goes on behind the scenes. The backend is 
        essentially the part of a website that the user doesn’t actually see. It is responsible for storing and organizing 
        data, and ensuring that everything on the client-side runs smoothly. It does this by communicating with the frontend.
        
        Whenever something happens on the client-side—say, a user fills out a form—the browser sends a request to the server-side. 
        The server-side “responds” with relevant information in the form of frontend code that the browser can then interpret and display.
        
        Learn more: What’s the difference between frontend and backend?
        
        Database technology
        Websites also rely on database technology. The database contains all the files and content that are necessary for a 
        website to function, storing it in such a way that makes it easy to retrieve, organize, edit, and save. 
        The database runs on a server, and most websites typically use some form of relational database management system (RDBMS).
        
        To summarize: the frontend, backend, and database technology all work together to build and run a fully 
        functional website or application, and these three layers form the foundation of web development.
        
        The difference between web development and web design
        You might hear the terms web development and web design used interchangeably, but these are two very different things.
        
        Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build a car: the developer would take care of all the 
        functional components, like the engine, the wheels and the gears, while the designer would be responsible for both 
        the visual aspects—how the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, the design of the seats—and for the user experience 
        provided by the car, so whether or not it’s a smooth drive.
        
        Web designers design how the website looks and feels. They model the layout of the website, making sure it’s logical,
         user-friendly and pleasant to use. They consider all the different visual elements: what color schemes and fonts will
          be used? What buttons, drop-down menus and scrollbars should be included, and where? Which interactive touchpoints
           does the user interact with to get from point A to B? Web design also considers the information architecture of the website, 
           establishing what content will be included and where it should be placed.
        
        Web design is an extremely broad field, and will often be broken down into more specific roles 
        such as User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and Information Architecture.
        
        It is the web developer’s job to take this design and develop it into a live, fully functional website. A frontend 
        developer takes the visual design as provided by the web designer and builds it using coding languages such as HTML, 
        CSS and JavaScript. A backend developer builds the more advanced functionality of the site, such as the checkout function on an e-commerce site.
        
        In short, a web designer is the architect, while the web developer is the builder or engineer.

        3. A brief history of the World Wide Web
        The web as we know it today has been decades in the making. To help understand how web development works, 
        let’s go back to where it all started and consider how the internet has evolved over the years.
        
        A timeline showing the history of the World Wide Web
        
        1965: The first WAN (Wide Area Network)
        The internet is essentially a network of networks, connecting all different WANs. WAN stands for Wide Area Network, 
        a telecommunications network that spans a large geographical distance. The first WAN was established in 1965 at the 
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Later on, this WAN would be known as ARPANET. It was initially funded by the 
        Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense.
        
        1969: The first ever internet message
        In October 1969, UCLA student Charley Kline sent the first ever internet message. He tried to send the word “login” 
        to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute via the ARPANET network, but the system crashed after the first two 
        letters. However, about an hour later, the system recovered and the full text was successfully delivered.
        
        1970s: The rise of the LAN (Local Area Network)
        The early 70s saw the development of several experimental LAN technologies. LAN stands for Local Area Network, a computer 
        network that connects nearby devices in the same buildings—such as in schools, universities, and libraries. Some notable 
        milestones include the development of Ethernet at Xerox Parc from 1973-1974, and the development of ARCNET in 1976.
        
        1982 – 1989: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), the Domain Name System and Dial-Up Access
        In 1982, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) emerged as the ARPANET protocol, and TCP/IP 
        remains the standard internet protocol today. In 1983, the Domain Name System was established, providing a more user-friendly 
        way of labelling and designating websites (i.e. careerfoundry.com instead of a series of numbers). In 1987, Cisco shipped 
        its first router, and in 1989, World.std.com became the first commercial provider of dial-up internet access.
        
        1990: Tim Berners-Lee and HTML
        In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) developed HTML—HyperText
         Markup Language. HTML became, and still is, a fundamental building block of the internet.
        
        1991: The World Wide Web Goes Mainstream
        With the rise of the visual internet browser, the World Wide Web made its way into the mainstream. As of 2018, 
        there are more than 4 billion internet users around the globe. This has risen to 4.66 active users in January 2021, 
        or 59.5% of the global population, according to Statista.
        
        4. What does a web developer do?
        The role of the web developer is to build and maintain websites. Web developers can work in-house or freelance, 
        and the specific tasks and responsibilities involved will vary depending on whether they’re working as a frontend,
         backend or full-stack developer. Full-stack developers specialize in both the frontend and backend; we’ll go into 
         more detail about what a full-stack developer does later on.
        
        Web developers are responsible for building a product that meets both the client’s needs and those of the customer 
        or end user. Web developers collaborate with stakeholders, clients and designers in order to understand the vision: 
        how should the final website look and function?
        
        A large part of web development also revolves around identifying and fixing bugs in order to constantly optimize 
        and improve a website or system. Web developers are therefore keen problem solvers, regularly coming up with 
        solutions and workarounds to keep things running smoothly.
        
        Of course, all web developers are proficient in certain programming languages. However, different developers 
        will work with different languages depending on their specific job title and area of expertise. Let’s 
        take a look at the different layers of web development and the associated tasks in more detail.

        A comparison of the tasks of a frontend developer vs. backend developer vs. full-stack developer
        What does a frontend developer do?
        It is the frontend developer’s job to code the frontend of a website or application; that is, the part of the 
        website that the user sees and interacts with. They take the backend data and turn it into something that is 
        easily comprehensible, visually pleasing and fully functional for the everyday user. They will work from designs 
        provided by the web designer and bring them to life using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (more on those later!).
        
        The frontend developer implements the website’s layout, interactive and navigational elements such as buttons 
        and scrollbars, images, content and internal links (links that navigate from one page to another within the same 
        website). Frontend developers are also responsible for ensuring optimal display across different browsers and 
        devices. They will code the website in such a way that makes it responsive or adaptive to various screen sizes, 
        so that the user gets the same experience whether they’re visiting the website on mobile, desktop or tablet.
        
        Frontend developers will also carry out usability tests and fix any bugs that arise. At the same time, they will 
        consider SEO best practices, maintain software workflow management, and develop tools that enhance how the user 
        interacts with a website in any browser. You can get a good taste of the work of a frontend developer by watching 
        this video tutorial, and registering for our free course for beginners, in which you’ll build your very first website from scratch.
        
        
        What does a backend developer do?
        The backend is essentially the brains behind the face (the frontend). A backend developer is therefore 
        responsible for building and maintaining the technology needed to power the frontend, consisting of three 
        parts: a server, an application, and a database.
        
        The code that backend developers create ensures that everything the frontend developer builds is fully 
        functional, and it is the backend developer’s job to make sure that the server, application, and database 
        all communicate with each other. So how do they do this? First, they use server-side languages such as PHP, 
        Ruby, Python, and Java to build the application. Then they use tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to 
        find, save or edit data and deliver it back to the user in frontend code.
        
        Just like frontend developers, backend developers will liaise with the client or business owner in order to 
        understand their needs and requirements. They will then deliver these in a number of ways depending on the specifics of the project.
        
        Typical backend development tasks include creating, integrating and managing the database, building 
        server-side software using backend frameworks, developing and deploying content management systems 
        (for a blog, for example), as well as working with web server technologies, API integration and operating systems.
        
        Backend developers are also responsible for testing and debugging any backend elements of a system or application.

        What does a full-stack developer do?
        A full-stack developer is someone who understands, and can work across, the “full stack” of technology: 
        i.e. both the frontend and the backend. Full stack developers are experts in every stage of the web 
        development process, meaning they are well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide on strategy and best practices.
        
        Most full-stack developers have gathered many years of experience in a variety of different roles, 
        giving them a solid grounding across the entire web development spectrum. Full-stack developers are 
        proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. 
        They are also well-versed in both business logic and user experience.
        
        Mobile developers
        Web developers may also specialize in mobile app development, either for iOS or Android.
        
        iOS developers build apps that run with the iOS operating system—the one used by Apple devices. iOS developers 
        are fluent in Swift, the programming language that Apple created specifically for their apps.
        
        Android developers build apps that are compatible with all Android devices, such as Samsung smartphones. 
        Java was the official programming language for Android, but has since been replaced by Kotlin, the new kid on the block.

        5. Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks
        In order to build websites and apps, web developers work with languages, libraries, and frameworks. 
        Let’s take a look at each of these in detail, as well as some other tools that web developers use in their day-to-day work.
        
        What are languages?
        In the world of web development, languages are the building blocks that programmers use to create 
        websites, apps and software. There are all different types of languages, including programming languages, 
        markup languages, style sheet languages, and database languages.
        
        Programming languages
        A programming language is essentially a set of instructions and commands which tell the computer to produce 
        a certain output. Programmers use so-called “high-level” programming languages to write source code. 
        High-level languages use logical words and symbols, making them easy for humans to read and understand. 
        High-level languages can be classified as either compiled or interpreted languages.
        
        C++ and Java, for instance, are compiled high-level languages. They are first saved in a text-based 
        format that is comprehensible for human programmers but not for computers. In order for the computer to 
        run the source code, it needs to be converted to a low-level language; i.e. machine code. Compiled languages 
        tend to be used to create software applications.
        
        Interpreted languages like Perl and PHP do not need to be compiled. Instead, source code written in 
        these languages can be run through an interpreter—a program that reads and executes code. Interpreted 
        languages are generally used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.
        
        Low-level languages are those that can be directly recognized by and executed on the computer hardware; 
        they don’t need to be interpreted or translated. Machine language and assembly language are some common 
        examples of low-level languages.
        
        Some of the most popular programming languages of 2018 include Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Perl.

        Markup languages
        Markup languages are used to specify the formatting of a text file. In other words, a markup language 
        tells the software that displays the text how the text should be formatted. Markup languages are completely 
        legible to the human eye—they contain standard words—but the markup tags are not visible in the final output.
        
        The two most popular markup languages are HTML and XML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is 
        used for the creation of websites. When added to a plain text document, HTML tags describe how this document 
        should be displayed by a web browser. To understand how HTML works, let’s take the example of bold tags. 
        The HTML version would be written as follows:
        
        <b>Make this sentence bold!</b>
        
        When the browser reads this, it knows to display that sentence in bold. This is what the user sees:
        
        Make this sentence bold!

        XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language very similar to HTML. However, while 
        HTML was designed to display data with a focus on how it looks, XML was designed purely to store and transport 
        data. Unlike HTML, XML tags are not predefined; rather, they are created by the author of the document.
        
        The point of XML is to simplify data sharing and transport, platform changes and data availability, as 
        it provides a software and hardware-independent means of storing, transporting and sharing data. You can 
        learn more about XML and how it works in W3schools’ guide.
        
        Style sheet languages
        A style sheet is basically a set of stylistic rules. Style sheet languages are used, quite literally, to 
        style documents that are written in markup languages.
        
        Consider a document written in HTML and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a style sheet language. 
        The HTML is responsible for the content and structure of the web page, while CSS determines how this content 
        should be presented visually. CSS can be used to add colours, change fonts, insert backgrounds and borders, 
        as well as to style forms. CSS is also used to optimize web pages for responsive design, ensuring they adapt 
        their layout to whatever device the user is on.

        Database languages
        Languages are not only used for building websites, software and apps; they are also used to create and 
        manage databases.
        
        Databases are used to store huge volumes of data. The Spotify music app, for example, uses databases to 
        store music files, as well as data about the user’s listening preferences. Likewise, social media apps 
        like Instagram use databases to store user profile information; every time a user updates their profile 
        in some way, the app’s database will also update.
        
        Databases are not designed to understand the same languages that apps are programmed in, so it’s 
        essential to have a language that they do understand—like SQL, the standard language for accessing and 
        manipulating relational databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It has its own markup, and 
        basically enables programmers to work with the data held in a database system. We’ve created a cheatsheet 
        to get you started using SQL.
        
        What are libraries and frameworks?
        Web developers also work with libraries and frameworks. Despite much confusion, they are not the same 
        thing—although they are both there to make the developer’s job easier.
        
        Libraries and frameworks are essentially sets of prewritten code, but libraries are smaller and tend 
        to be used for more specific use-cases. A library contains a collection of useful code, grouped together 
        to be reused later. The purpose of a library is to enable developers to reach the same end goal while writing less code to get there.
        
        Let’s take the example of JavaScript, the language, and jQuery, a JavaScript library. Rather than 
        writing, say, ten lines of code in JavaScript, the developer can take the condensed, prewritten 
        version from the jQuery library—saving time and effort.
        
        Learn more: JavaScript vs. jQuery—What’s the difference?
        
        A framework contains ready-made components and tools that enable the developer to write code faster, and many 
        frameworks also contain libraries. It gives the developer a structure to work from, and the framework you choose 
        to work with will largely dictate the way you build your website or app, so choosing a framework is a big decision. 
        Some popular frameworks include Bootstrap, Rails, and Angular.
        
        The easiest way to understand libraries and frameworks is to imagine you are building a house. 
        The framework provides the foundation and the structure, as well as instructions or guidelines 
        for completing certain tasks.
        
        Say you want to install an oven in your new home: you could buy the separate components and 
        build the oven from scratch, or you could pick a ready-made oven from the store. Just like building a website,
         you can write the code from scratch or you can take pre-written code from a library and simply insert it.

        Other web development tools
        Web developers will also use a text editor, such as Atom, Sublime or Visual Studio Code, to write their 
        code; a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox; and an extremely crucial tool: Git!
        
        Git is a version control system where developers can store and manage their code. As a web developer, it’s 
        inevitable that you’ll make constant changes to your code, so a tool like Git that enables you to track 
        these changes and reverse them if necessary is extremely valuable. Git also makes it easier to work 
        with other teams and to manage multiple projects at once. Git has become such a staple in the world 
        of web development that it’s now considered really bad practice not to use it.
        
        Another extremely popular tool is GitHub, a cloud interface for Git. While we explain more about what 
        it is and how to use it in our GitHub guide, essentially this tool offers all the version control 
        functionality of Git, but also comes with its own features such as bug tracking, task management and project wikis.
        
        GitHub not only hosts repositories; it also provides developers with a comprehensive toolset,
         making it easier to follow best practices for coding. It is considered the place to be for open-source projects, 
         and also provides a platform for web developers to showcase their skills. You can learn more about 
         the importance of GitHub in our article.
